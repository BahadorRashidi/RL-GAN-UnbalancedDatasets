## Preprocessing CWRU Dataset For The Projecty
In this folder, we download the case western university bearing dataset and apply appropriate preprocessing in order to mimic an imbalance dataset scenario ready for benchmarking the proposed solutions.

## Procedure:
Since the base concept of the project is to apply RL for performing anomaly detection and diagnosis, one viable pre-processing form of the data is trasnforming the time-series into images. With this aim, we utilize the Gramian Angular Field (GASF) and (GADF) as well as REcurrent plot and Marov Transition Field (MTF)
